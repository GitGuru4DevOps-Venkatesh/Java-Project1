**Automate Git and GitHub Tasks with a Simple Shell Script  Step-by-Step Tutorial**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Introduction

"Hello, everyone! Welcome back to the channel. Today, we have a practical tutorial where we'll be automating some common Git and GitHub tasks using a simple shell script. Let's dive in!"

Step 2: Overview of the Shell Script

"Alright, let's take a quick look at the script. This shell script automates the process of cloning source code from an existing GitHub repository, creating a new repository on GitHub, and copying the source code into the new repository. Let's break it down."

Step 3: Explanation of Variables

"Firstly, we have these variables. You'll need to replace yourusername, source-repo, new-repo, and YourAccessToken with your GitHub username, repository names, and a valid GitHub access token, respectively."

Step 4: Demonstrating Cloning Source Code

"Now, let's kick things off by cloning the source code from our existing repository. The git clone command is used for this purpose. Make sure to replace the URL with your actual repository URL."

Step 5: Demonstrating Creating a New Repository

"Next up, we'll use the GitHub API to create a new repository. This involves sending a curl request with your GitHub access token. Ensure that your token has the necessary permissions."

Step 6: Demonstrating Cloning the Newly Created Repository

"With the new repository created, we'll clone it using the familiar git clone command. Copy the URL from your newly created repository on GitHub and replace it in the script."

Step 7: Demonstrating Copying Source Code

"Now comes the part where we copy the source code from the original repository to the new one. Simple cp commands do the trick."

Step 8: Demonstrating Committing and Pushing Changes

"Time to commit and push our changes. The usual Git commands come into play here: git add ., git commit, and git push. Make sure to replace main if you're using a different branch."

Step 9: Conclusion

"And there you have it! We've successfully automated the process of cloning, creating, and uploading source code using a simple shell script. Feel free to customize it based on your needs. If you found this helpful, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more content."

Step 10: Q&A and Troubleshooting

"Now, If you encounter any issues, let's troubleshoot them together."

**"Thank you so much for joining me today. I hope you found this tutorial valuable. Remember, the script and additional resources are in the description below. Until next time, happy coding!"**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a shell script to automate these steps. Below is an example of a simple shell script that combines the described steps. Save this script with a `.sh` extension, and make it executable using the `chmod +x script_name.sh` command or use this one also chmod 777 script_name.sh` command. Then, you can run it using `./script_name.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set your repository URLs
source_repo_url="https://github.com/repositoryname/source-repo.git"
new_repo_url="https://github.com/repositoryname/new-repo.git"

# Clone source code from GitHub to local
git clone "$source_repo_url"

# Create a new repository on GitHub
# (You may need to replace 'YourAccessToken' with a valid GitHub access token)
curl -u "YourAccessToken:x-oauth-basic" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"new-repo"}'

# Clone the newly created repository
git clone "$new_repo_url"

# Switch to the previously cloned repository
cd source-repo

# Copy source code to the newly created repository
cp -r ./* ../new-repo

# Switch to the new repository
cd ../new-repo

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Copy source code from source-repo"
git push origin main

echo "Script executed successfully!"
```

Note:

Must and should please replace `yourusername`, `source-repo`, `new-repo`, and `YourAccessToken` with your GitHub username, repository names, and a valid GitHub access token.
Make sure to replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you're using a different branch.
